👋 Hi, I’m @generileyr
👀 I’m interested in data visualization, machine learning, and scientific computing.
🌱 I’m currently learning Python libraries like Matplotlib, Pandas, and TensorFlow.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data-driven projects, analytics tools, and machine learning applications.
😄 Pronouns: They/Them
⚡ Fun fact: I can turn any dataset into a compelling story with just a few visualizations!
